# Shippo Code Practices
**Shippo Code Practices Program** created by me in 2017 in order to make a training program suited for my company - Shippo's developers. It should contains many exercises in many levels.

### Prerequisites ###

You should have basic knowledge about Node.js, Javascript, Typescript. 

In order to take part in, you should install these into your environment:

- Node.js
- Mochajs (a javascript test framework)
- TypeScript (you should use **ntypescript** instead of **typescript**)

> In this program, we only use Mocha.js as testing framework. To go further in TDD/BDD, you should use chai.js with mocha to make test cases more nature-language likes. And chai.js support selenium driver, too (or you can use nightwatch.js, we should have plenty of testing framework in this era.

The program should be update with new practice contents every week. Every practice should have both English and Vietnamese text (because, after all, we are a company based in Vietnam).

## Summary ##

### Week #1: TDD at the first sight ###
